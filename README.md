# Go Game 3D

This project is an engineering thesis that explores gameplay enhancements for one of the oldest known board games — **Go**.  
The classic version of Go is played on a square board with intersecting lines where players alternately place black or white stones to capture territory.  

The main goal of this project was to extend the traditional rules and mechanics of Go by introducing **non-standard board variants** and adapting the gameplay accordingly.

## Features

- **Classic Go board** (9x9, 13x13, 19x19 with standard rules)
- **Looping board** – board edges are connected, creating continuous play
- **Cube-shaped board** – 3D variant mapped onto the surface of a cube
- **Sphere-shaped board** – stones placed on a curved, spherical grid
- **Full Go rules support**:
  - stone capturing
  - the *ko* rule
  - territory scoring
- **User interface**
